The exceptions to this license is as follows:
* Bootstrap by Twitter and the Glyphicon set are licensed under the GPL-compatible [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 Apache License v2.0]

* WP StrapGrid is a light and clean Twitter Bootstrap theme for WordPress.
* With support for grid format layout of posts, Bootstrap carousel and an 
* Introduction widget on the home page. It comes with the options to hide
* the navbar (menu) and the carousel for the home page plus the ability to
* hide the theme credits (altough we'd rather you didn't) and add your own
* custom copyright in the footer. Further more the footer is fully widgetized
* to give you more real estate to showcase more of your content.

* WP StrapGrid is translation ready!

* Please note: By design, in Bootstrap the parent menu for dropdown setting is not
* clickable!

* This is the light version with the basics but still an aesthetically
* visual and functional theme.

* Support for RTL (Right To Left) layout is included althought this is
* yet to be fully tested. So for all those that compose content in an
* RTL language I welcome your feedback and support in making this feature
* right for you all - please report any bugs and I'll do my best to fix
* them ASAP. Code contribution is welcome.

== Theme Install And Set Up ==

* The theme can be installed just like anyother theme - either via FTP
* or by uploading it via Admin >> Appearance >> Install Themes

* For full documentation and theme demostration please visit our site
